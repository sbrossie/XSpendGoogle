iPhone application to track family spending 

I. Overview

I.1 Requirements

Requires having a google account.

I.2 Dependencies and Layout

All dependencies should be checked-in within the project and references from Xcode should be relative to those
dependencies, so it is easy to share the project across devs.

The layout of the application is:
- iPhoneApp : The code for the iPhone app. There are a couple of very small classes taken from other projects (Regex)
There are also directories for images/icons that are needed as a reference from XCode
- gdata-objectivec-client-1-1 : The google framework is help communicate with various services. The code is compiled in such a way that we only use the Spreadsheet* services -- see (http://code.google.com/p/gdata-objectivec-client/wiki/GDataObjCIntroduction#Adding_Google_Data_APIs_to_a_project). Also note that version a 1-1 had a memory leak and i patched the code; the latest version might be fixed, i did not try.


II. Description

II.1 Usage
